<p class="pa1"><span class ="sp1">T</span>here are millions of  people all around the world who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme  fitness. Since you don&rsquo;t have to move around the court too fast, it&rsquo;s great for  people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing  them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is  fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there&rsquo;s always  a net between you and your opponents. <br />
Beach volleyball is suitable for people of  all ages, and men and women alike.
Anyone considering starting a new sport or  exercise program should see a doctor first.</p>
